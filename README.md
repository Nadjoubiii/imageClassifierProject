Hello Everyone, I wanted to share a project that I'm working on

Just a simple number prediction website where you upload the image of a number to the website and it transforms it to gray scale and the appropriate size then feeds it into a 99.4% accurate Convulutional Neural Network based Tensorflow model that predicts the class of the number from 0 to 9

I have used Django and plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the Backend and Frontend respectively
